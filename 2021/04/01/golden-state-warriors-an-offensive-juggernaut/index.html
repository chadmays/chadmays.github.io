<p>The 21st century saw basketball change. The game has developed so much over the last 21 years. But the game has also drastically changed over the last few years. Teams have begun shooting the ball at rates far higher than we’ve ever seen before. One of the main reasons for that is the Golden State Warriors.</p>
<p>Following a disappointing first round exit to the Los Angeles Clippers in 2014, the Warriors ownership group decided to fire Mark Jackson and hire then TV analyst Steve Kerr. Kerr went on to lead the Warriors to a remarkable run in which they made five straight NBA Finals and won three of them. The Warriors dominated basketball offensively. They were doing things that no team had never done before.</p>
<p>How good were they? Let’s take a look.</p>

<p>The two data sets are taken from Sports Reference NBA site. The first data set is the offensive data is the offensive data for every NBA team for each season since the 2000-01 season until the 2019-20 season. The second set of data simply takes each of those teams and has the number of wins they had each of those years. I then joined them together to create one data set.</p>
<p>The first thing I want to do is find the offensive z-score for each of these teams and put them into a table. The z-score in this situation would be the distance from the mean offense. So a larger z-score would indicate a good offense while a lower z-score would represent a bad offense.</p>
<p>So to start, I am going to use the data created earlier to find the offensive z-score for every single team in each season. The offensive z-score is created by adding up the z-scores for field goal percentage, three point percentage, assists and points.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>teamzscore &lt;- NBA %&gt;% 
  mutate(
     FGzscore = as.numeric(scale(FGPPCT, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
     Threezscore  = as.numeric(scale(ThreePPCT, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
     ASTzcore = as.numeric(scale(AST, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
     PTSzscore = as.numeric(scale(PTS, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
     Offensivezscore = round(FGzscore + Threezscore + ASTzcore + PTSzscore, digits = 2)
  )</code></pre>
<p>Now that I have created a new data set that has offensive z-scores for each team, those offensive z-scores will be put into a table that has the top 10 teams with the best offensive z-scores.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tablez &lt;- teamzscore %&gt;% 
  group_by(Team, Season) %&gt;%

<p>It is pretty clear the Warriors under Steve Kerr have been dominant, minus the last two seasons. They not only have the five of the seven best offensive z-scores of the 21st century, their top four are much larger then the rest of the pack. The top z-score, the 2015-16 Warriors, is the year the Warriors set the all time win record with 73. That team was practically unstoppable until game 5 of the NBA Finals, but we will not discuss that.</p>
<p>This data isn’t the only data that shows the Warriors dominance. To further look at how good they were during this time, we will take the offensive z-score and show it on the x-axis and the points score per game on the y-axis. This chart will include all 596 teams in the data. The Warriors will be highlighted in their signature yellow as well as the year of the team labeled above it.</p>

As the chart says, there are really only four major good outliers in this data. But the crazy part, is that all four of these outliers are the 2015-2019 Warriors. Those teams were in a leauge of their own in the regular season. Those teams include the team that set the record for most wins in NBA history and the Durant Warriors. The 2014-15 Warriors were still a very strong team, but they are not other worldy crazy in their statistics like the other four Warriors teams. But this data shows that a higher offensive z-score will lead to higher points scored.</p>
<p>While we have looked at offensive stats such as points and offensive z-score, the most important stat of them all is wins. Wins are everything in sports. Everyone knows the Warriors have won a lot under Steve Kerr, they are 360-164 under him. The key to their winning was shooting the ball. So that begs the question as to whether or not, the Warriors are the best shooting team of the 21st century. To do this, we need to look at the field goal z-score, points, and wins. The field goal z-score is the combination of z-scores of two point percentage, three point percentage, and free throw percentage.</p>

<p>The evidence shows that the Warriors under Steve Kerr, until last year and this year, were one of the NBA’s best offenses of the 21st century. They dominated teams with great and efficient shooting and strong passing. While some players were added, such as Kevin Durant, the core of the team from 2014-19 was very simialr to the core of the team in the years prior. How much of the offensive impact was from Steve Kerr’s system he implemented? The team’s in blue are all the Warriors teams the consisted of Curry, Thompson, and Green before Kerr became the coach. The yellow are the Kerr led Warriors from 2014-19.</p>

Yes the core got older and more experienced, but the jump they made from 2013-14 to 2014-15, Kerr’s first year, isn’t just because they had one more lap around the sun. Kerr’s offense was a big reason they made that big leap.</p>
<p>The Warriors dominated the NBA for a five year stretch. That is an impressive feat no matter the league or sport. Being the best and most dominant offense for that long of a stretch makes it quite clear that during the 21st century, no team came close to the offensive of dominance the Warriors had. While that run has come to an end, it is unlikely we will see that sustained dominance again for long a time. The Warriors were truly a treat to watch night in and night out.</p>
