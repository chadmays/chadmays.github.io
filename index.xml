      <description>Welcome to my blog! Featured here will be a variety of things including some data visualizations project primairly aimed at sports data, as that is what I am passionate about.
I love watching and playing sports. I am a huge fan of all Bay Area teams, except the A&amp;rsquo;s and Raiders (even though they now play in Las Vegas).</description>
